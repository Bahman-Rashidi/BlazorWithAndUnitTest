# BlazorSLN

I developed a Blazor project that consumes an API, includes a login system,
and provides forms for CRUD operations. The CRUD operations are not directly connected to the database but are handled through proper abstraction.
The project also implements unit testing and follows a Dependency Injection architecture.
